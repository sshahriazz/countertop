      <p className="text-xs-semibold text-sm-regular flex justify-center">Quartz slabs are engineered stones made from a blend of crushed natural quartz and resin.<br></br> Typically, they consist of about 90-95% quartz and 5-10% resin.
Quartz is known for its durability. It's hard, scratch-resistant, and less prone to chipping compared to natural stone.
These slabs are non-porous, making them resistant to stains and bacteria. They require minimal maintenance, usually just wiping with a damp cloth and mild detergent.
Available in a wide range of colours and patterns, quartz can mimic the look of natural stone such as granite and marble.
Quartz is commonly used for kitchen countertops, bathroom vanities, and other interior surfaces.
Being an engineered product, quartz slabs can have a varied environmental impact depending on the manufacturing process. Some brands offer eco-friendly options.
Generally, quartz is in the mid-to-high price range among countertop materials. Its cost reflects its quality and longevity.
Professional installation is recommended due to the weight and precision required in handling quartz slabs.
